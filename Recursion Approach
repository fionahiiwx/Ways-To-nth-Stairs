## When the nth step of the stairs = 1,2,3,4..., the answers to the corresponding nth term would form a Fibonacci seq (1,1,3,5..).
## It'll keep repeating the function to find the (n-1)th and (n-2)th step to sum it up to be the total number of steps for nth step.
## If n is 0 or 1, the answer would just be 1 as it can only take one step.
